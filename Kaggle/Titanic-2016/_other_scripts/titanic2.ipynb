    "### Kaggle Competition | Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster \n",
    "\n",
    ">The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.  This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n",
    "\n",
    ">One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.  Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In this contest, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.  In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\n",

    "### Let's take a look:\n",
    "\n",
    "Above is a summary of our data contained in a `Pandas` `DataFrame`. Think of a `DataFrame` as a Python's super charged version of the workflow in an Excel table. As you can see the summary holds quite a bit of information. First, it lets us know we have 891 observations, or passengers, to analyze here:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Int64Index: 891 entries, 0 to 890\n",
    "\n",
    "Next it shows us all of the columns in `DataFrame`. Each column tells us something about each of our observations, like their `name`, `sex` or `age`. These colunms  are called a features of our dataset. You can think of the meaning of the words column and feature as interchangeable for this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "After each feature it lets us know how many values it contains. While most of our features have complete data on every observation, like the `survived` feature here: \n",
    "\n",
    "    survived    891  non-null values \n",
    "\n",
    "some are missing information, like the `age` feature: \n",
    "\n",
    "    age         714  non-null values \n",
    "\n",
    "These missing values are represented as `NaN`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Take care of missing values:\n",
    "The features `ticket` and `cabin` have many missing values and so canâ€™t add much value to our analysis. To handle this we will drop them from the dataframe to preserve the integrity of our dataset.\n",

    "To do that we'll use this line of code to drop the features entirely:\n",

    "Now we have a clean and tidy dataset that is ready for analysis. Because `.dropna()` removes an observation from our data even if it only has 1 `NaN` in one of the features, it would have removed most of our dataset if we had not dropped the `ticket` and `cabin`  features first.\n",

    "#### Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained by Wikipedia:\n",
    ">In statistics, logistic regression or logit regression is a type of regression analysis used for predicting the outcome of a categorical dependent variable (a dependent variable that can take on a limited number of values, whose magnitudes are not meaningful but whose ordering of magnitudes may or may not be meaningful) based on one or more predictor variables. That is, it is used in estimating empirical values of the parameters in a qualitative response model. The probabilities describing the possible outcomes of a single trial are modeled, as a function of the explanatory (predictor) variables, using a logistic function. Frequently (and subsequently in this article) \"logistic regression\" is used to refer specifically to the problem in which the dependent variable is binaryâ€”that is, the number of available categories is twoâ€”and problems with more than two categories are referred to as multinomial logistic regression or, if the multiple categories are ordered, as ordered logistic regression.\n",
    "Logistic regression measures the relationship between a categorical dependent variable and one or more independent variables, which are usually (but not necessarily) continuous, by using probability scores as the predicted values of the dependent variable.[1] As such it treats the same set of problems as does probit regression using similar techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The skinny, as explained by yours truly:\n",
    "Our competition wants us to predict a binary outcome. That is, it wants to know whether some will die, (represented as a 0), or survive, (represented as 1). A good place to start is to calculate the probability that an individual observation, or person, is likely to be a 0 or 1. That way we would know the chance that someone survives, and could start making somewhat informed perdictions. If we did, we'd get results like this:: \n",

    "**Wikipeda:**\n",
    ">In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks[1]) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data and recognize patterns, used for classification and regression analysis. The basic SVM takes a set of input data and predicts, for each given input, which of two possible classes forms the output, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples into one category or the other. An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall on.\n",
    "In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From me\n",
    "The logit model we just implemented was great in that it showed exactly where to draw our decision boundary or our 'survival cut off'.  But if youâ€™re like me, you could have thought, \"So uhhh, what if a straight line just doesnâ€™t cut it\". A linear line is okay, but can we do better? Perhaps a more complex decision boundary like a wave, circle, or maybe some sort of strange polygon would describe the variance observed in our sample better than a line.  Imagine if we were predicating survival based on age. It could be a linear decision boundary, meaning  each additional time you've gone around the sun you were 1 unit more or less likely to survive. But I think it could be easy to imagine some sort of curve, where a young healthy person would have the best chance of survival, and sadly the very old and very young a like: a poor chance. Now thatâ€™s a interesting question to answer. But our logit model can only evaluate a linear decision boundary. How do we get around this? With the usual answer to life the universe and everything;  $MATH$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The answer:**\n",
    "We could transform our logit equation from expressing a linear relationship like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$survived  = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1pclass + \\beta_2sex + \\beta_3age + \\beta_4sibsp + \\beta_5parch + \\beta_6embarked$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which we'll represent for convenience as: \n",
    "$y = x$\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "\n",
    "to a expressing a linear expression of a non-linear relationship: \n",
    "$\\log(y) = \\log(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this we're not breaking the rules. Logit models are *only* efficient at modeling linear relationships, so we're just giving it a linear relationship of a non-linear thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "An easy way to visualize this by looking at a graph an exponential relationship. Like the graph of $x^3$:\n",
    "\n",
    "![x3](https://raw.github.com/agconti/kaggle-titanic/master/images/x3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here its obvious that this is not linear. If used it as an equation for our logit model, $y = x^3$; we would get bad results. But if we transformed it by taking the log  of our equation, $\\log(y) = \\log(x^3)$. We would get a graph like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![loglogx3](https://raw.github.com/agconti/kaggle-titanic/master/images/loglogx3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "That looks pretty linear to me. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process of transforming models so that they can be better expressed in a different mathematical plane is exactly what the Support Vector Machine does for us. The math behind how it does that is not trivial, so if your interested; put on your reading glasses and head over [here](http://dustwell.com/PastWork/IntroToSVM.pdf). Below is the process of implementing a SVM model and examining the results after the SVM transforms our equation into three different mathematical plains. The first is linear, and is similar to our logic model. Next is an exponential, polynomial, transformation and finally a blank transformation.\n"

This technique is a form of non-parametric modeling that does away with all those equations we created above, and uses raw computing power and a clever statistical observation to tease the structure out of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "An anecdote to explain how this the forest works starts with the lowly gumball jar. We've all guess how many gumballs are in that jar at one time or another, and odds are not a single one of us guessed exactly right. Interestingly though, while each of our individual guesses for probably were wrong, the average of all of the guesses, if there were enough, usually comes out to be pretty close to the actual number of gumballs in the jar. Crazy, I know.  This idea is that clever statistical observation that lets random forests work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do they work?** A random forest algorithm randomly generates many extremely simple models to explain the variance observed in random subsections of our data.  These models are like our gumball guesses. They are all awful individually. Really awful. But once they are averaged, they can be powerful predictive tools. The averaging step is the secret sauce. While the vast majority of those models were extremely poor; they were all as bad as each other on average. So when their predictions are averaged together, the bad ones average their effect on our model out to zero. The thing that remains, *if anything*, is one or a handful of those models have stumbled upon the true structure of the data.\n",
